# Music-recommender
The number of songs available exceeds the listening capacity of an individual in their lifetime. It is tedious for an individual to sometimes to choose from millions of songs and there is also a good chance missing out on songs which could have been the favourites.
Music service providers like Spotify need an efficient way to manage songs and help their customers to discover music by giving a quality recommendation. For building this recommendation system, they deploy machine learning algorithms to process data from a million sources and present the listener with the most relevant songs.
These streaming services, like Spotify, Apple Music or Pandora, are using this data to provide recommendations to their listeners. These music recommendation systems are part of a broader class of recommender systems, which filter information to predict a user's preferences when it comes to a certain item.
